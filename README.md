- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jim-Hahn

Retired EE.  Worked on big Arduino hobby project 5+ years ago.  
Find I now need to write some simple C programs to investigate some stuff in math and physics.
Tried to download Eclipse to no end.  WAY too many crazy things it assumes you know how to do.
Started simply reusing the Arduino environment.  Wish it had a debugger but that's life.
Discovered 'wokwiki'.  
Basically works fine as a closed environment, as is Arduino.
Could not get its debugger to work but this morning it does.  Sort of.
Wanted to input bugs/funnies to developer and a note says to "use this link to report issues". That link puts me into github which I have heard of but never used.
Just got an account and we'll see how it goes!
